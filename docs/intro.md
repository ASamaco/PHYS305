# Introduction

Modern science relies heavily on computational methods and data
analysis, in addition to empirical evidence and scientific theory.
PHYS 305 offers a comprehensive introduction to the essential skills
needed for computation- and data-driven astrophysics.
The course covers a range of computational and numerical methods,
including the integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), equipping students with the
tools necessary to solve complex problems in upper level physics.
In addition, students will learn modern statistical methods,
encompassing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and apply these
techniques to physical research.
The curriculum is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with
practical applications.
Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects,
students will develop a robust understanding of the essential tools
and techniques required for modern astrophysical research.
