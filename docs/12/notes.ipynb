    "Bayesian statistics systematically combines our prior knowledge about a situation with new data to refine what we believe is true.\n",
    "In countless real-world scenarios---ranging from medical diagnostics to fundamental physics experiments---information we already have (like the rarity of a disease or theoretical constraints on a physical parameter) can significantly shape how we interpret fresh evidence.\n",
    "By framing unknowns as probability distributions, Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework for updating those distributions whenever new observations appear, yielding a posterior that reflects all evidence, old and new.\n",
    "This unifying perspective makes it possible to quantify uncertainties in a transparent way, avoid common logical pitfalls, and naturally propagate errors to any derived quantities of interest."
