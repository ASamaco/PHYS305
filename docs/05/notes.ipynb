    "ls file?.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `[]`: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets. Example: `ls file[12].txt` matches `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls file[12].txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Create an alias for `ls -la`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "alias ll='ls -la'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Make the alias permanent by adding it to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"alias ll='ls -la'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
