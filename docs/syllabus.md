## Course Description

Modern science relies heavily on computational methods and data
analysis, in addition to empirical evidence and scientific theory.
PHYS 305 offers a comprehensive introduction to the essential skills
needed for computation- and data-driven physics.
This course covers a range of computational and numerical methods,
including integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), equipping students with the
tools necessary to solve complex problems in upper level physics.
In addition, students will learn modern statistical methods and apply
these techniques to physical research.
The curriculum is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with
practical applications.
Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects,
students will develop a robust understanding of the essential tools
and techniques required for modern astrophysical research.

This course is a prerequisite for the following courses: PHYS 332, PHYS 426, PHYS 472.

## Assessments

Assessment Categories | Percentage of Final Grade
--- | ---
6 Homework Assignments | 60%
Project I (Mid-Term)   | 20%
Project II (Final)     | 20%
Total                  | 100%

## Grading Scale and Policies

There are 6 homework assignments and 2 projects in total.
Each homework assignment worth 10 points and each project worth 20 points.
Students are expected to submit their assignments and projects by the specified deadlines.
Requests for extensions must be made prior to the due date.

This course provides regular letter grades (A–E), which are based on a simple point system:
* A: 80–100 points
* B: 70–79.9 points
* C: 60–69.9 points
* D: 50–59.9 points
* E:  0–49.9 points

No scaling will be applied.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) grades must be made in accordance with university policies.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on a homework assignment or a project, the student must send the instructor a formal request through email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time that the student receives the grade.
Because no scaling will be applied in the final grade, the final grade cannot be re-evaluated.
The student is expected to know his or her own performance throughout the course.

## Biography

Prof. Chi-kwan "CK" Chan is a computational astrophysicist working with cutting edge technologies to advance both theoretical and observational research.
He has developed new algorithms to study magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, used graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate general relativistic ray tracing, designed cloud computing infrastructures to handle big observational data, and applied machine learning algorithms to speed up and automate data processing.
Some of CK's active projects include simulating and understanding accretion disks, capturing images of black holes, and visualizing astrophysical simulations in virtual reality.
A true wildcat, CK received his bachelors and doctoral degrees from the University of Arizona.
