## Course Description

Modern science relies heavily on computational methods and data
analysis, in addition to empirical evidence and scientific theory.
PHYS 305 offers a comprehensive introduction to the essential skills
needed for computation- and data-driven physics.
This course covers a range of computational and numerical methods,
including integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), equipping students with the
tools necessary to solve complex problems in upper level physics.
In addition, students will learn modern statistical methods and apply
these techniques to physical research.
The curriculum is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with
practical applications.
Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects,
students will develop a robust understanding of the essential tools
and techniques required for modern astrophysical research.
