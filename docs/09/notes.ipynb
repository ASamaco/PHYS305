    "Root finding and optimization are core numerical techniques that enable us to solve complex equations and optimize functions in fields where analytical solutions are often impossible.\n",
    "Root finding aims to determine values for which a function $f(x) = 0$, and finds application across engineering, physics, and financeâ€”whether calculating stresses in materials, energy levels in quantum mechanics, or rates of return in investments.\n",
    "Optimization seeks to find the minimum or maximum of a function and is especially crucial in machine learning, where minimizing loss functions directly affects model performance.\n",
    "The two concepts intersect in gradient-based optimization, where finding the roots of a gradient helps locate stationary points and optimize complex models."
