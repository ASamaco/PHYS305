    "  The simplest system, where each number is represented by identical marks.\n",

    "  An improvement over unary, Roman numerals use symbols such as I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000).\n",
    "  However, representing numbers like 888 (DCCCLXXXVIII) still requires 12 symbols, making it cumbersome and inefficient for large numbers.\n",

    "  A revolutionary advancement, the Arabic numeral system uses positional notation to represent numbers compactly and efficiently.\n",
    "  For instance, 888 requires only three digits, drastically reducing complexity and enhancing clarity, making it the foundation of modern mathematics."

    "### Positional Notation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arabic numeral system is an example of a **positional notation system**, where the value of a digit is determined by both the digit itself and its position within the number.\n",
    "This contrasts with systems like Roman numerals or unary numbers, where the position of a symbol does not affect its value.\n",
    "In positional notation, each digit's place corresponds to a specific power of the system's base.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a positional system, representing a number involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Decide on the base (or radix) $b$.\n",
    "2. Define the notation for the digits.\n",
    "3. Write the number as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\pm (\\dots d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0 . d_{-1} d_{-2} d_{-3} \\dots),\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   which represents:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\pm (\\dots + d_3 b^3 + d_2 b^2 + d_1 b^1 + d_0 b^0 + d_{-1} b^{-1} + d_{-2} b^{-2} + d_{-3} b^{-3} + \\dots).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a number from base $b$ to decimal, we apply this definition directly. For example:\n",
    "$$\n",
