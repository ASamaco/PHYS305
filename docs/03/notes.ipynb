    "## Fundamental Roles of Linear Algebra in Computational Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a foundation in modern mathematics.\n",
    "It enables multidimensional calculus, multivariate statistics, differential geometry, functional analysis, control theory, and more.\n",
    "It enables systematic and predictable problem-solving.\n",
    "It is fair to say we understand most of the linear mathemtics.\n",
    "When faced with non-linear problems, it is common to transform them into linear approximations for analysis and solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical linear algebra further enhances this power, extending it to computational physics.\n",
    "It enables solving partial differential equations (PDEs), optimization problems, eigenvalue analyses, and more.\n",
    "By bridging theory and computation, numerical linear algebra helps solving some of the most challenging problems in physics and engineering."
