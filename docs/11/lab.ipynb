    "This effect is explained by relativistic beaming plus light-travel-time*geometry, not an actual violation of relativity.\n",

    "1. **Model** a population of quasar jets launched at speed $\\beta c$ in random directions.\n",
    "2. **Compute** each jet's apparent transverse velocity $\\beta' \\equiv v'/c$.\n",
    "3. **Compare** your empirical distribution of $\\beta'$ with a known theoretical result.\n",
    "4. **Estimate** mean values and build confidence intervals, tying in concepts from parameter estimation.\n",
    "5. **Explore** possible bias if only jets above some detection threshold are \"observed\".\n",

    "This exercise demonstrates how **random orientation** plus **relativistic speeds** yield \"superluminal\" expansions in a statistical sample, and how the distribution is theoretically predictable."
