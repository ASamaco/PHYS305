    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific computing and machine learning, interpolation and extrapolation are fundamental tools for estimating function values at new data points based on known information.\n",
    "* In machine learning, all standard supervised learning tasks can be viewed as interpolation problems in high-dimensional space. Here, models predict outputs **within the range** of their training data.\n",
    "* However, when attempting to make predictions outside this range, we face significant challenges in making reliable extrapolations.\n",
    "  Extrapolation is a particularly challenging task because models typically lack information  beyond their training data."

    "### Interpolation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation plays a crucial role in scientific computing and machine learning by estimating function values at new data points based on known information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polynomial interpolation is versatile but can exhibit significant oscillations, particularly at the edges of data (Runge's phenomenon).\n",
    "* This can be mitigated by using rational functions, which offer more stable estimates and are better suited to handle asymptotic behavior.\n",
    "* Spline interpolation, especially cubic splines, is valued for its smoothness and continuity up to the second derivative. This makes it effective for applications requiring a smooth fit."

    "Extrapolation remains a difficult task, yet physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a promising avenue.\n",
