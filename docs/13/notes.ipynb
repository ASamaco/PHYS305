    "### Why does Machine Learning (ML) matter in Computational Physics?\n",
    "* Large volumes of data are often generated from simulations and experiments in physics.\n",
    "* In astronomy, the Rubin Observatory (formerly LSST) will generate terabytes of data every single night, leading to petabytes over the duration of the survey.\n",
    "* Traditional analytical approaches might struggle with complex, high-dimensional data;\n",
    "  ML provides powerful tools to find patterns, classify transient events, estimate redshifts, and more.\n",
    "* ML has proven effective across many domains (image recognition, natural language processing, etc.), and these techniques can be adapted to solve challenging physics and astronomy problems."
