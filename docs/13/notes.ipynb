    "### Why does Machine Learning (ML) matter in Computational Physics?\n",
    "* Large volumes of data are often generated from simulations and experiments in physics.\n",
    "* In astronomy, the Rubin Observatory (formerly LSST) will generate terabytes of data every single night, leading to petabytes over the duration of the survey.\n",
    "* Traditional analytical approaches might struggle with complex, high-dimensional data;\n",
    "  ML provides powerful tools to find patterns, classify transient events, estimate redshifts, and more.\n",
    "* ML has proven effective across many domains (image recognition, natural language processing, etc.), and these techniques can be adapted to solve challenging physics and astronomy problems."

    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  * In supervised learning, we have labeled data:\n",
    "    each data point $x$ has an associated label $y$ (e.g., a category in classification, a numeric value in regression).\n",
    "* **Common Tasks:**\n",
    "  * **Classification:** Predict discrete labels (e.g., whether an event is a supernova or a variable star).\n",
    "  * **Regression:** Predict continuous values (e.g., estimating photometric redshifts for galaxies).\n",
    "* **Examples in Physics & Astronomy (Rubin/LSST):**\n",
    "  * **Galaxy Classification:** Labeling galaxies as spiral, elliptical, irregular, etc. using images.\n",
    "  * **Transient Detection:** Classifying new light*curve data to determine the type of transient event.\n",
    "  * **Redshift Estimation:** Regressing a redshift value from photometric measurements."

    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  * In unsupervised learning, we only have unlabeled data.\n",
    "    The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data without predefined labels.\n",
    "* **Common Tasks:**\n",
    "  * **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., finding different galaxy populations).\n",
    "  * **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of variables while retaining essential information (e.g., using PCA to compress wide*field survey data).\n",
    "* **Examples in Physics & Astronomy (Rubin/LSST):**\n",
    "  * **Event Grouping:** Automatically grouping observed transients based on their light*curve shapes without prior labeling.\n",
    "  * **Feature Extraction:** Identifying the principal components of large*scale survey images to highlight underlying structures or key features in the data."

    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  * An agent interacts with an environment, making decisions based on a reward or penalty signal.\n",
    "    The goal is to learn a strategy (policy) that maximizes long*term reward.\n",
    "* **High-Level Idea and Relevance:**\n",
    "  * While less common in astronomy data processing, reinforcement learning can be useful for **telescope scheduling** (optimally deciding where to point the telescope to maximize scientific returns) or **adaptive optics** (adjusting system parameters in real time)."
