    "### Importance of Integration in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration is foundational in physics, as many physical systems are described by differential equations that represent dynamic behaviors.\n",
    "For instance, Newton's second law, $f = m a = m d^2 x/d t^2$, is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that models the acceleration of a mass under a force.\n",
    "When physical phenomena are modeled as continuous fields, we often move to partial differential equations (PDEs), such as those governing fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the behavior of these systems, we frequently need to integrate these differential equations, either over time, space, or other domains.\n",
    "Analytical solutions, though ideal, are rarely feasible for real-world problems due to the complex nature of the equations and boundary conditions.\n",
    "This makes numerical integration essential for approximating solutions in computational physics, enabling us to simulate and analyze physical systems that defy closed-form solutions."

    "### Numerical Integration of Functions\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "I = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "In many ways, this task is a special case of solving an initial-value problem for an ODE.\n",
    "Specifically, computing the integral $I$ is equivalent to solving the differential equation $d y/d x = f(x)$, with a boundary condition $y(a) = 0$, and evaluating $y(b)$.\n",
    "This perspective connects integration directly to the broader framework of solving differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing first on the numerical integration of functions, we will see the key concept of convergence---the manner in which a numerical approximation approaches the true value as computational parameters (like step size) are refined.\n",
    "This foundation will prepare us for tackling more general ODEs and PDEs, where convergence and error control are critical for obtaining reliable solutions."
