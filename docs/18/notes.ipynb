    "Computational physics often begins with the notion that classical equations can perfectly predict the evolution of a system if one knows the initial conditions precisely.\n",
    "However, many real-world processes involve an inherent level of randomness or produce outcomes so sensitive to initial conditions that they effectively appear random.\n",
    "Radioactive decay, governed by quantum mechanics, is an example of truly non-deterministic behavior, whereas chaotic classical systems like the three-body problem can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\n",
    "As a result, introducing randomness into our computational methods is not only natural for modeling genuinely stochastic systems but also highly advantageous even in deterministic settings."

    "Monte Carlo methods, which rely on random sampling to estimate quantities of interest, illustrate how such randomness can be leveraged as a powerful tool in numerical analysis.\n",
    "The phrase \"Monte Carlo\" alludes to the famous casino district in Monaco, highlighting the essence of \"gambling\" with random draws to tackle challenging problems.\n",
    "Since their popularization in mid-twentieth-century nuclear research, Monte Carlo algorithms have found widespread use in evaluating high-dimensional integrals, simulating physical processes in statistical mechanics, performing error analysis in data-driven fields, and more.\n",

    "Although real physical systems may exhibit genuine randomness (as seen in quantum events), computer algorithms generate numbers through deterministic procedures.\n",
    "These \"pseudo-random\" sequences are designed to mimic statistical randomness but are entirely reproducible given a specific initial seed.\n",
    "In practice, a well-crafted pseudo-random number generator can satisfy the statistical requirements of scientific simulations, especially if it has a sufficiently large period and low correlations across many dimensions. Modern generators such as the Mersenne Twister, PCG, and Xorshift provide excellent performance in these regards, far surpassing the simpler linear congruential generators of older programming standards."
