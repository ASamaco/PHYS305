    "Computational physics often begins with the notion that classical equations can perfectly predict the evolution of a system if one knows the initial conditions precisely.\n",
    "However, many real-world processes involve an inherent level of randomness or produce outcomes so sensitive to initial conditions that they effectively appear random.\n",
    "Radioactive decay, governed by quantum mechanics, is an example of truly non-deterministic behavior, whereas chaotic classical systems like the three-body problem can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\n",
    "As a result, introducing randomness into our computational methods is not only natural for modeling genuinely stochastic systems but also highly advantageous even in deterministic settings."

    "In practice, a well-crafted pseudo-random number generator can satisfy the statistical requirements of scientific simulations, especially if it has a sufficiently large period and low correlations across many dimensions. Modern generators such as the Mersenne Twister, PCG, and Xorshift provide excellent performance in these regards, far surpassing the simpler linear congruential generators of older programming standards."
